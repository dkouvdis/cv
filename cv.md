## Profile

I'm a Frontend developer based in London with over fourteen years of development experience, including in the commercial/FinTech industry sector. I specialise in producing high-quality interfaces for client-side applications in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.

I am university educated with B-Tech in Multimedia and consistently scored over 90% in the UI/UX section of Adobe Flash projects throughout my studies. Interactive/UI developments are my specialty.

My job is not solely to write code. My aim is to deliver an exceptionally functional end product, which adheres to high standards for all platforms.

Over the years developing, Iâ€™ve moulded myself into a well-rounded individual who appreciates best practice and progressively keeps up with new web technologies.
