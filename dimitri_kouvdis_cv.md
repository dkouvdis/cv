## Profile

I'm a Front-end / Full-stack developer based in London with over fourteen years of development experience, including in the commercial/FinTech industry sector. I specialise in producing high-quality interfaces for client-side web applications.

I am university educated with B-Tech in Multimedia and consistently scored over 90% in the UI/UX section of Adobe Flash projects throughout my studies. Interactive/UI developments are my speciality.

My job is not solely to write code. I aim to deliver an exceptionally functional end product, which adheres to high standards for all platforms.

Over the years of developing, I've moulded myself into a well-rounded individual who appreciates best practice and progressively keeps up with new web technologies.
